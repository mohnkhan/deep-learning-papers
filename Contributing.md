# Contributing Guide

You can directly edit(add/delete/modify) the [README.md](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/README.md) file for contribution. If you don't know how to edit the file, please leave a message to the [Issue board](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/issues).

## Awesome list criteria

- **2016** :    +20 citations (:sparkles: +50)
- **2015** :  +100 citations (:sparkles: +200)
- **2014** :  +200 citations (:sparkles: +400)
- **2013** :  +300 citations (:sparkles: +600)
- **2012** :  +400 citations (:sparkles: +800)
- **2011** :  +500 citations (:sparkles: +1000)
- **2010** :  +600 citations (:sparkles: +1200)

This criteria is not a strict baseline, but a **flexible guideline** for being added to the awesome list. (Since the number of citations is affected by the research area, some papers under the threshold may be added to the list while some over the threshold may not.) If you add papers which are under the above criteria, please provide **enough descriptions** which the papers should be added.

## Edit the awesome list
You can **add / delete / modify** the papers on the awesome list.

#### Addition
As mentioned above, please provide **enough descriptions** when you push a request, especially for the papers which do not meet the criteria or for the papers for the *Papers Worth Reading* section.

Here is an example of markdown code for a paper on the list.

`Distilling the knowledge in a neural network (2015), G. Hinton et al. [[pdf]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531)`

The pdf link which can directly download the pdf file rather than links to another webpage is preferred. If the number of authors are more than two, please write the first author's name only.

#### Deletion
If a paper seems to be out-of-date or be a duplication of another paper, you can suggest deletion. Deletion is also an important contribution to maintain a tractable number of papers on the awesome list.

#### Modification
Modification (or Updates) that can usually happen is
- addition of :sparkles: marks (as increasing number of citations)
- addition of distinguished researchers
- move papers from a section from another
- correction of typo, grammatical error, etc.

Note that you are *not* allowed to add or modify the sections.
